                            <p className="pt-10 pb-3">Crypto-based lending is a new, comparatively unregulated space. The rapid evolution of technology and business practices bears the risk of unethical, irresponsible, or simply uninformed actors provoking regulatory overreach that can stifle innovation and the opportunities inherent in this sector.  The CCA aims to prevent and mitigate potential market volatility from bad practices, and to pre-empt the need for highly restrictive regulations by fostering the creation of a thoughtful, informed, and pragmatic code of conduct for industry participants.</p>
